## Are We In a Housing Crisis?

### The question of a possible housing crisis is something that many are speculating due to certain economic indicators pointing towards it. Looking at the data from the charts above, we can see that housing prices, inflation rates and interest rates have all taken a sudden uptrend due to COVID-19. This data indicates that we may be experiencing a housing crisis because rising housing prices will cause higher demand due to housing becoming significantly less affordable. To combat this, interest rates have risen quite drastically recently to counter this, however, this may have a net negative affect since it is becoming much more expensive to get a mortgage.

## Is there an Impact on Housing from Population Growth and Immigration?

### This chart comparing population growth to the number of immigrants coming to Canada from 2005-2022 indicates that there has been a surplus of immigration in canada since the beginning of 2020. As more immigrants move to Canada,  they will need places to live which may lead to higher demands for housing and increased housing prices.
