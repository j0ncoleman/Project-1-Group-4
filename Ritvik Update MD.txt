## Q: What are Some Key Factors that Could Make Housing Affordable?

The Canadian government took regulatory measures by banning international investment in housing within Canada but this is definitely not enough as international investments only contribute to 2% of total real-estate bought in Canada. But we think that there are a few key factors that could make housing affordable and some of the leading factors that we considered included investments in proptech and new housing developments in Canada and statistics showcased through these are very promising. As the PropTech industry is relatively new especially in Canada, there has been a recent surge in investment dating from 2018 all the way to 2022. With initial investment in mature companies through private equity but later represented by early stage investments in startups in 2021 and 2022. These startups include companies such as Pine, Properly, and Addy that increase affordability through alternative payment options, or decreases transaction costs, or introduces easier split ownership of property. 
On the other hand, new housing developed in Canada will increase the supply of housing to hopefully reduce prices further. New developments have been stagnant from 2002 to 2006 but took a dip from 2007-2009 during the recessionary period and have been slowly increasing every since. From 2020-2021, new developments increased by 25% and are expected to maintain that level in 2022. 

## Investments Within the PropTech Industry In Canada

The graph below shows how much money proptech companies in Canada have raised over the years to relate back to how these companies can help to combat the effect of increasing housing prices within Canada. The stacked bar chart also shows the stage in which these companies are, with a majority of these companies being in their early stage of their business cycles with growth in private equity investment in late stage companies as well. A lot of these companies focus on increasing affordability to first-time homebuyers through alternative mortgage solutions, diverse equity offerings, and lower transaction costs with ease of purchasing/renting real-estate. PropTech investment has increased drastically largely due to the increase in housing prices. We see a lot of companies with new developments within the space. Compiled data from PropTech Collective Canada also show that there was a surge of new startups from 2015-2016 within this space, with an increase of over 32% in new companies in the PropTech industry. These companies are in their midstage currently, seeking late stage venture capital money or becoming established to IPO over the next couple years. In fact, 78% of Canadian PropTech companies were founded over the last decade but yet 71% of them are still in their seed stage. As a result, there is still a huge investment opportunity within the PropTech industry, to capitalize on how unaffordable housing in Canada has become and provide aid to help with these investments. 

The nearing recession, increasing rates, and the big impact in growth companies, brought down valuations but also removed a lot of capital from venture capital and private equity firms to make new investments. Due to this, investments in PropTech companies declined from 2021-2022 but these investments were still significantly more than the years 2019-2020.

## Graphically Representing New Houses Developed Per Quarter Over the Last 20 Years

This graph below shows new houses that have been developed over time. From 2002-2007, we can see a constant amount of new houses build within Canada but as we go through recessionary times in 2008 and 2009, new developments decrease drastically. From 2010-2020, housing developments are constant around 175,000 new houses per year. The Canadian economy and government did anticipate a rise in housing prices and were expected to increase development further in 2020. This however, did not occur due to the global pandemic, reducing the priority of municipal governments to focus on housing over the response to the pandemic. But housing development did increase even further with a 25% increase in new developments from 2020 to 2021. 2022 is expected to produce slightly lower amount of housing than 2021 but still significantly more than the years prior to 2021.

## Graphically Representing Owned vs Rented Property in 2021

The graph below shows the percentage of people that live in a house that they own in comparison to the percentage of people that live in a rented property. This percentage has been decreasing ever-so-slightly over the last census data as housing becomes more unaffordable for people to purchase adding on to our thesis.
